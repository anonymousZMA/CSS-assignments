# CSS Properties

This repository contains the source code for my CSS Properties Assignment. In this assignment, I practiced using different properties in CSS, including font-size, font-family, border, background-color, etc.

## Assignment Requirements:

1. Open your project from the previous HTML assignments (links-and-images)
2. Add any inline style for h1 of your homepage
3. Create a directory named css within the links-and-images directory and create a
   cascade stylesheet named ‘style.css’ which all of your HTML files will be linked to
4. Within that style.css add properties to customize the page to your liking, make sure that
   you include the following:
   a. Background color
   b. Text color
   c. Font family
   d. Font size
   e. Borders
   f. Rounded corners on images

Remember that you can customize the pages to your liking, you will not be graded in any way on how it looks as it’s a personal preference, but make sure to use at least all of the properties mentioned above in the list
