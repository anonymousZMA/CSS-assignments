# CSS-assignments
This repository contains my solutions to various CSS assignments that demonstrate my proficiency in using different CSS properties to style and design web pages.

## Assignments Overview
Each assignment involved designing and styling a web page using different CSS properties, such as:

- Box model: Using properties such as padding, margin, and border to adjust the size and spacing of elements on the page.
- Flexbox: Using Flexbox layout to create a responsive design and easily position elements on the page.
- Fonts: Using different font styles, sizes, and weights to improve readability and visual appeal.
- Colors: Using color properties such as background-color, color, and opacity to create a color scheme that complements the content.
- Animations and transitions: Using CSS animations and transitions to add movement and visual interest to the page.

I used HTML, CSS, and various CSS properties to create the different assignments. 
I used Git for version control and hosted the pages using GitHub Pages.
